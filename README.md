# Synthetic_Data_generation
Generating synthetic data using python for analysis.
<ol>
    <li><b>healthcare.py:</b> Data of 200 patients in a clinical trial containing variables like age, blood_pressure, cholesterol, treatment_group, recovery_time, survival_time & event_observed. Useful for hypothesis testing, correlation & regression analysis, survival analysis.
    <li><b>cardio.py:</b> Generate a cardiovascular dataset having demographic, clinical & lifestyle attributes. Also calculate the risk score and heart disease probability for each patient. This data can be used for EDA.
    <li><b>health_time_series.py:</b> A time-series data of 365 days for glucose, systolic_bp and cholesterol. Useful for time-series modelling and forecasting.
    <li><b>signal_synthetic.py:</b> Generate a signal dataset consisting of 5Hz and 20 Hz frequencies. Useful for learning Fourier transformation.
    <li><b>earthquake.py:</b> Simulating vibration data from a 10-story building during an earthquake to dentify the building's natural frequencies that could cause damage.
    <li><b>EEG.py:</b> Simulating EEG data from a patient to identify different brain wave patterns and dominant brain wave frequencies for neurological assessment.
